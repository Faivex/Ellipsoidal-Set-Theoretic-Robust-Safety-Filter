# Ellipsoidal Set-Theoretic Robust Safety Filter

This repository provides MATLAB implementations of robust safety filters for constrained linear systems, as presented in our paper "Ellipsoidal Set-Theoretic Design of Robust Safety Filters for Constrained Linear Systems."

## Overview

Safety filters are supervisory control mechanisms that ensure safety-critical constraints are satisfied while minimally interfering with nominal controller performance. This implementation demonstrates an ellipsoidal set-theoretic approach for synthesizing robust safety filters that:

- Compute robust controlled invariant (RCI) ellipsoidal sets via convex LMI optimization
- Provide formal safety guarantees under bounded disturbances
- Enable smooth transitions between nominal and backup controllers
- Scale efficiently to high-dimensional systems

The method is validated on a 6-DOF quadrotor system with hierarchical position-attitude control under wind disturbances.

## Files Description

### Main Simulation Scripts
- `quadrotorScenario_I.m` - Nominal operation with small position errors
- `quadrotorScenario_II.m` - Large initial position errors requiring safety intervention
- `quadrotorScenario_III.m` - Aggressive high-frequency circular trajectory tracking

### Core Functions
- `loadSystemParameters.m` - Quadrotor parameters (mass, inertia, etc.) for Crazyflie 2.0
- `defineEquilibriumPoint.m` - Hover equilibrium point calculation
- `linearizeModel.m` - Attitude dynamics linearization around equilibrium
- `robustControlDesign.m` - LMI-based RCI set and backup controller synthesis
- `computeAttitudeLinearizationErrorBound.m` - Rigorous linearization error bounds
- `plotResults.m` - Comparative visualization of safe vs. unsafe scenarios
- `formatFigureIEEE.m` - IEEE-standard figure formatting

## Usage

1. **Run a simulation scenario**:
```matlab
   quadrotorScenario_II  % Large position errors scenario
```

2. **The simulation pipeline**:
   - Loads Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor parameters
   - Linearizes attitude dynamics around hover
   - Designs robust safety filter via LMI optimization
   - Simulates closed-loop system with/without safety filter
   - Generates comparative plots showing safety guarantees

3. **Key parameters** (configurable in scenario scripts):
   - Roll/pitch constraints: |φ|, |θ| ≤ 40°
   - Torque limits: |τ_i| ≤ 1×10⁻⁴ N·m
   - Disturbance bound: ||d|| ≤ 1×10⁻⁵ N·m
   - Mixing function thresholds: h_min = 0.1, h_max = 0.9

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) - Convex optimization toolbox
- [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) or SeDuMi - SDP solver
- Control System Toolbox

### Installation
1. Install CVX from http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/
2. Install MOSEK solver (academic license available)
3. Add CVX to MATLAB path:
```matlab
   addpath('path/to/cvx')
   cvx_setup
```

## Simulation Results

The three scenarios demonstrate:

**Scenario I**: Minimal intervention during safe operation (h ≪ 1)
- Safety filter remains inactive
- Nominal performance preserved

**Scenario II**: Prevention of instability from large position errors
- Without filter: Roll/pitch constraints violated → instability
- With filter: Smooth intervention maintains safety and stability

**Scenario III**: Robust tracking under aggressive circular trajectory
- Without filter: System becomes unstable
- With filter: Stable circular-like trajectory maintained

All scenarios include wind disturbances: d(t) = [sin(2t), cos(2t), 0]^T
